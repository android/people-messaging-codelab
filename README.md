# People & Messaging chat app

This chat app is an extension of the [Jetchat chat app](https://github.com/android/compose-samples/tree/main/Jetchat),
integrating the [People and messaging APIs](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/conversations).
The chat app can stand alone as a sample showcasing the various APIs that enable chat apps to
leverage the people centric features in Android but also serves as the sample code for the
[People and messaging codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/people-messaging) 

To try out this sample app, you need to use 
[Android Studio Arctic Fox](https://developer.android.com/studio)
You can clone this repository or import the
project from Android Studio following the steps
[here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/setup#sample).

## Known issues

This app has the same known issues mentioned in the Jetchat app. Note also, that like the Jetchat app,
it only simulates a conversation with random non-relevant responses with the purpose of just showcasing
the features that are relevant to messaging.
